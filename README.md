# Stock Trend Prediction
This project demonstrates how to predict stock trends using historical data from financial markets. The data is fetched using the yfinance library, and basic data processing is applied to prepare it for analysis. This project leverages machine learning techniques to scale and predict stock prices based on historical trends.

# Project Structure

1) Data Loading: The stock data is fetched from Yahoo Finance using yfinance. It pulls historical stock prices between a specified start date (2010-01-01) and the current date.
2) Data Preprocessing: The data is processed to reset indices and prepare it for further analysis or modeling.
3) Exploration: The stock data for a particular company (e.g., Apple or Samsung) is explored, including opening, high, low, and close prices.
4) Libraries Used
•pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
•yfinance: To download historical stock data.
•datetime: For working with dates.
•sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler: For scaling data to improve model performance.
•numpy: To handle numerical operations.

# How to Run the Project
Prerequisites
1) Install the required Python libraries:

pip install pandas yfinance scikit-learn numpy

2) Ensure you have a stable internet connection to download the stock data from Yahoo Finance.

# Running the Project
1) Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2) Select a stock ticker (e.g., Apple - AAPL, Samsung - 005930.KS).
3) Run the notebook cells to load, preprocess, and visualize the stock data.
4) Additional functionality like machine learning models can be integrated for predictions.
